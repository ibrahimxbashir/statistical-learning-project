# Coronavirus Cases and Demographic Analysis in Israel

This project aims to model and predict a response variable new_cases/population (where new_cases represents new cases of coronavirus on a specific day in Israel by town/locality, and population is the corresponding population size) according to a selection of various demographic variables in a corresponding town/locality in Israel. I decide to first fit Ridge regression models of various lambdas on the data (all done manually, i.e. independently defined ridge fitting functions) and interpret the results. Then fit models using cross-validation in accordance with the 'glmnet' R package to estimate optimal lambda and alpha parameters (so perhaps rather Lasso or ElasticNet models), and finally calculate an RMSPE (root mean squared predicted error) of the model according to test and validation data sets.

### Important notes
The code related to the project is done in R, but saved in a .Rmd file. I attached an html knit of the code as well, however, the file is too big to preview on github. To remedy this, you can click on the html file, click on 'View raw', then copy and paste the URL of the raw version of the html on this site: https://htmlpreview.github.io/. This will enable you to view the results and the plots as well as the code. The code includes an interactive bubble map which is still omitted from the original html, but I have included a screenshot of the bubble map as a .png which I will also show below:

### Further context
This project is a part of a submission relating to my coursework in statistics in The Hebrew University of Jerusalem; the specific course in reference is 'Statistical Learning and Data Analysis' (52525). The data sets included in these analyses are the coronavirus cases from 24/12/2020-7/1/2020 in Israel by locality, as well as the demographic data of each locality; both of these data sets can be found on Israel's Ministry of Health website, I will include a link to the dashboard but keep in mind it can only be navigated in Hebrew: https://datadashboard.health.gov.il/COVID-19/general?utm_source=go.gov.il&utm_medium=referral.
